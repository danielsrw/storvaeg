	                    As consumers ourselves, we share your concern about privacy. And as a consumer, you do and should have the right to know what happens to your personal information! Let me begin by saying that we do not and will not ever provide your confidential information beyond the facilitation of the business transaction or in requested correspondence with us or our Partners. We are committed to respecting your privacy and recognizing your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you share with us (the phrases "personally identifiable information" or "personal information" mean any information by which you can be identified, such as your name, address, telephone number, etc.). This Privacy Notice is posted to demonstrate our adherence to the practices you'll find common to the best websites online. We promise that we will treat your information with the same honesty and sensitivity that we have displayed throughout our company's history.
	                </li>
	                <li>
	                	Obviously, we collect basic information including your name, home address, phone number, email address and credit card information when you place a secure order with us via our Encrypted Order Process. As with any retail type transaction, we use this information to process your order and to respond to any questions or concerns you may have. Where required, we also share this information with certain partners in the facilitation of your order; for example, UPS and possibly the Product Manufacturers we represent so that they may contact you directly with product support information you request. Whether or not to provide such information is completely your own choice. But if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to purchase products, or access certain services, offers and content on our web site.
	                </li>
	                <li>
	                	When you make a purchase from us, it is possible that we will include you in our list to receive email updates about special offers, new products and services, and relevant product information. We may also share information gleaned from your use of our site or the purchases you make with companies with whom we have marketing or other business relationships. If for any reason you do not wish to receive this information or do not wish for us to provide information as described in this Privacy Policy, please reply to any of our emails and type "unsubscribe" in the subject line or send an e-mail to our customer service email to opt-out. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time for any reason. Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to 6-8 weeks to be effective, particularly if we are removing your name from postal mailings. In addition, when you purchase from us or when you choose to enter a sweepstakes or other promotion, we may need to contact you via phone, email or mail to address questions or issues specific to your order, entry, etc., even if you have opted to not receive communications.

	                <li>
	                	In return for making a purchase or registering at our site, it is possible that at times we may offer to keep you informed of new and ongoing benefits, exclusive sales and promotions and other customer-only benefits. We appreciate any additional, optional information you are willing to share with us. This optional information helps us tailor your experience at our site, showing you content that we think might be interesting to you. Depending on the information you give us, we will also provide you with relevant information, gift ideas, and other special offers.

	                	As a leading Retailer, we have extensive security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information that we collect. We utilize an elaborate firewall in addition to industry leading-continuously updated SSL encryption to keep your information secure. We use your Internet Protocol or IP address to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad demographic information. Our site uses cookies to keep track of the items in your shopping cart so you don't have to take time to re-enter them each time you visit.

	                <li>
	                	Acceptance of cookies is not a requirement to browse our products however our shopping cart does require the acceptance of cookies to work properly.

	                	As we stated earlier, we use sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of your personal information that you share with us. Unfortunately, however, as with any retail transaction whether physical or virtual, nothing can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our website, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will do our best to protect its security on our systems. We constantly train our staff on a "Safe Internet Experience". As we do with everyone we train, we urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also, remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet cafe, or at work!

	                <li>
	                	At times, there are options to 'Share products with a friend or family member' features on our site(s) that allow you to easily share product or other valuable information with your friends or family. Any e-mail addresses provided to us in the use of these features are used solely for direction of our internal e-mail communication. These e-mail addresses are not used for any other communication other than for the purpose they are originally solicited. Again, as we stated earlier, we do not sell information!

	                <li>
	                	This Privacy Notice and our Terms of Use will change over time and the use of information which we gather now is subject to these Notices and Terms as modified. Please check this page periodically as you continue to use our site to see if any changes have been made. This privacy notice was most recently changed on 2/1/2021.

						If you have further questions about our privacy policy or have other comments on how we can improve your shopping experience, please do not hesitate to e-mail our customer service email address. We always enjoy hearing from you!
